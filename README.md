# Computer Engineering projects [CSE HCMUT]
This mega project includes many projects which were implemeted by junior students from CSE HCMUT.

## Classifying Objects on a Conveyor Belt Using Teachable Machine
This project classifies objects on a conveyor belt using Teachable Machine. The simulation is conducted in ROS and Gazebo environments. Teachable Machine is used to classification objects (toys).

## Autonomous driving car_1
This project demonstrates how an autonomous driving mobile robot drives on a map of roads in a simulation environment (the Gazebo simulator). Lane detection (computer vision-based) and sign recognition (CNN-based) are integrated into the robot (turtlebot3).

## Car Control By Hand Gestures
This project demonstrates how to control a car by hand gestures. mediapipe  is used for hand recognition and tracking. CNN and SSD are used to recognize pre-defined hand gesture. ROS and Gazebo for simulation with turtlebot3.
