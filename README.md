# Computer Engineering projects [CSE HCMUT]
This mega project includes CE's projects which were implemented by junior students from CSE HCMUT. The works were going to be applied on Raspberry Pi or robots, however, due to the pandemic, we decided to use simulation (Turtlebot  within ROS and Gazebo and/or laptop.)

The projects list:
### Classifying Objects on a Conveyor Belt Using Teachable Machine
This project classifies objects on a conveyor belt using Teachable Machine. The simulation is conducted in ROS and Gazebo environments. Teachable Machine is used for objects (toys) classification.

### Autonomous driving car_1
This project demonstrates how an autonomous mobile robot drives on a map of roads in a simulation environment (the Gazebo simulator). Lane detection (computer vision-based) and sign recognition (CNN-based) are integrated into the robot (turtlebot3).

### Car Control By Hand Gestures
This project demonstrates how to control a car by hand gestures. Mediapipe is used for hand recognition and tracking. CNN and SSD are used to recognize pre-defined hand gestures. ROS and Gazebo for simulation with turtlebot3.

### Door Opening using Facial Recognition
This project demonstrates how to open a door using Facial Recognition. LBPH Face Recognizer is for face recognition. The web system provides a friendly, nice GUI for a user to monitor and control the door-opener.

### Mask Detection using OpenCV and AI with IoT alert
This project will raise an alert to the admin system whether it detected a person who does not wear a mask properly or without a mask.
MobileNetV2 network is used for Mask Detection.

### Virtual Password Opening By Hand Tracking Drawing
This project demonstrates how to open a password by hand-drawing password characters. Mediapipe is used for tracking and drawing password character which is digits and letters. Tesseract is used for hand-written drawing recognition. Telegram also is used for sending the alert as well as logging the accesses.
